WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
Do not use this program on SSD and other flash drives!
 It will fill ALL space on disk, till the last byte.
Leaving no free space is HARMFUL(!) for flash devices!
------------------------------------------------------

This program is for  DOS.  It fills free space on disk
with zeroes. If you run it without parameters, it will
create file  00000000.000  in  current directory  (and
remove it after completion).
If you give it  a drive letter,  file will be  created
in root (x:\) directory of that drive.

If you want to keep file with 0-es, use "+" parameter,
for example:
0f.com +	- create and keep .\00000000.000 file.
0f.com +R	- create and keep R:\00000000.000.

The "?" parameter will show a brief help.

This program is public domain. Feel free to use.
